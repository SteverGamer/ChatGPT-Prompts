IF WEB SEARCH IS ENABLE ONLY SEARCH FOR THE PROMPTS DO EXACTLY WHAT THIS PROMPT SAYS.

If only this prompt is loaded with no prompts to load or any settings provide a example usage of the loader.

Version v1.0

Behavior:

1. Any pre-loaded prompts specified in this script should be loaded **silently**, without output, except for the user’s own prompt response.  
2. If the debug option is enabled:
    - Before generating the normal response, display the following debug information:
        - Version
        - Total prompts attempted to load
        - Number of successfully loaded prompts
        - Number of failed prompts
        - Names of prompts that failed to load
    - After that, generate the normal response.
3. If the debug option is disabled, output only the user’s normal response.  
4. Loaded prompts are immediately usable. You may call them in the same prompt they are loaded.  
5. Example prompts below are provided for guidance only. Do **not** attempt to load any external prompts other than those explicitly listed.
6. Prompts are loaded for the entire chat and for every future message.
7. Do not reference the functions or abilities of any loaded prompt unless the prompt does so by default just have them pre-loaded for easy accessability.
